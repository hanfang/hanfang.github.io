Han Fang is a Research Lead in Core LLM at Meta's AI Frontier org. In 2023-2024, He launched Llama 2 & 3 on Meta AI into Meta's family of apps, growing it to 1 billion monthly active users. In 2025, he focuses on teaching models to think and reason (becoming agents) and more broadly post training.
​

Han holds a PhD in Applied Mathematics and has published in top-tier venues with 7500+ citations. He is a recipient of the President’s Award to Distinguished Doctoral Students, the Woo-Jong Kim Dissertation Award, and the Excellence in Research Award.

* **Launched [Llama 3 on Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/) and subsequently Llama 3.1**.  
  Meta AI is an intelligent assistant that is capable of complex reasoning, following instructions, visualizing ideas, and solving nuanced problems. [Meta AI Blog Post](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/)

* **Launched [Llama 2](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/introducing-ai-powered-assistants-characters-and-creative-tools/) on [Meta AI](https://www.meta.ai/)**.  
  [My talk at Meta's Connect Conference](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2023/building-metas-next-generation-ai-product-experiences-with-llama/) in 2023

* **Built and deployed Meta AI Few-Shot Learner (FSL) that can adapt to new or evolving types of harmful content.**  
  It not only works in more than 100 languages, but also learns from different kinds of data, such as images and text, and it can strengthen existing AI models that are already deployed to detect other types of harmful content. [Meta AI Blog Post](https://ai.meta.com/blog/harmful-content-can-evolve-quickly-our-new-ai-system-adapts-to-tackle-it/)

* **Training AI to detect hate speech in the real world**  
  Built and deployed an innovative system called Reinforcement Integrity Optimizer (RIO). RIO is an end-to-end optimized reinforcement learning (RL) framework that is used to optimize hate speech classifiers.
