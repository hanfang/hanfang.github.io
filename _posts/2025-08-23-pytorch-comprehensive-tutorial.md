I've created a comprehensive PyTorch tutorial that covers everything from basic tensor operations to advanced topics like attention mechanisms and mixed precision training.

## What's Included

The tutorial consists of 5 progressive modules:

### Part 1: Tensor Basics
- Creating and manipulating tensors
- Basic operations and broadcasting
- GPU operations and NumPy integration
- Essential tensor operations

### Part 2: Autograd and Gradients
- Automatic differentiation fundamentals
- Higher-order gradients
- Custom gradient functions
- Gradient computation patterns

### Part 3: Neural Networks
- Building networks with `nn.Module`
- Training loops and optimization
- Complete XOR problem implementation
- Model saving and loading patterns

### Part 4: Common Problems and Solutions
- 10 practical coding problems with solutions
- Custom loss functions and optimizers
- Batch normalization from scratch
- Memory optimization techniques
- Model quantization strategies

### Part 5: Advanced Topics
- Multi-head attention implementation
- Mixed precision training
- Custom optimizers
- Learning rate scheduling with warmup
- Best practices for production

## Key Features

**Hands-on Implementation**: Every concept includes working code that you can run and modify.

**Progressive Difficulty**: Starts with basics and builds up to advanced transformer components.

**Best Practices**: Includes proper PyTorch patterns, debugging techniques, and optimization strategies.

**Practical Focus**: Real implementations that demonstrate core ML engineering concepts.

## Repository

The complete tutorial is available on GitHub: [pytorch-practice](https://github.com/hanfang/pytorch-practice)

## Why This Matters

In my experience at Meta working on Llama 2 & 3, I've seen how crucial it is to understand both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation details of deep learning systems. This tutorial bridges that gap by providing:

1. **Solid fundamentals** - Understanding tensors, gradients, and neural network basics
2. **Practical skills** - Real implementations of core ML concepts
3. **Advanced concepts** - Topics that are essential for deep learning practitioners
4. **Best practices** - Production-ready patterns and optimization techniques

Whether you're a student learning ML, a researcher exploring new techniques, or an engineer building production systems, this tutorial provides the hands-on PyTorch knowledge needed for modern deep learning.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanfang/pytorch-practice.git
cd pytorch-practice
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
python run_tutorial.py
```

The interactive runner lets you choose specific topics or run through the entire curriculum systematically.

I hope this resource helps the ML community learn and master PyTorch. The combination of theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills has been crucial in my own journey working on large-scale AI systems.
